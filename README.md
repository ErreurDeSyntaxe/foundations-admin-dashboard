This is the last project of the Intermediate HTML and CSS course of The Odin
Project, Full Stack JavaScript path. I have learned much since starting the
Foundations path, but the feeling of growth has continued throughout the current
course. I look forward to starting the JavaScript course. But first, I need
to start and complete this project.
